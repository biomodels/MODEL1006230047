**Abstract:**   
A mathematical model examined a potential therapy for controlling viral
infections using genetically modified viruses. The control of the infection is
an indirect effect of the selective elimination by an engineered virus of
infected cells that are the source of the pathogens. Therefore, this
engineered virus could greatly compensate for a dysfunctional immune system
compromised by AIDS. In vitro studies using engineered viruses have been shown
to decrease the HIV-1 load about 1000-fold. However, the efficacy of this
potential treatment for reducing the viral load in AIDS patients is unknown.
The present model studied the interactions among the HIV-1 virus, its main
host cell (activated CD4+ T cells), and a therapeutic engineered virus in an
in vivo context; and it examined the conditions for controlling the pathogen.
This model predicted a significant drop in the HIV-1 load, but the treatment
does not eradicate HIV. A basic estimation using a currently engineered virus
indicated an HIV-1 load reduction of 92% and a recovery of host cells to 17%
of their normal level. Greater success (98% HIV reduction, 44% host cells
recovery) is expected as more competent engineered viruses are designed. These
results suggest that therapy using viruses could be an alternative to extend
the survival of AIDS patients.
